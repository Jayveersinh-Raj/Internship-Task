# Internship-Task
I tried as much I can. I am not sure if it will run effectively. 

Since the provided code was not compiling, and had multiple bugs. I tried fixing the code, and it compiles now. It was not possible to get abi, or address since because of errors in compliation, the deployment was not feasible.

Then I code in javascript to link the contract with UI. I also had to use html and link javascript through it to create a website. Moreover, I forgot to mention Ganache, which I used to deploy the contract on blockchain. I am still on learning stage. I hope I did well till now. I hope you will consider this. By, the time of actual internships in June, I assure you, my work would be far better than this.
